Recursion in programming is something similar. It is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly1. This creates a cycle where the function solves a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem, until reaching a simple base case that can be solved directly.</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0204-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0204-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function, in simple terms, is a block of code that executes only when called. You can think of it as a small program within your main program, designed to perform a specific task1. A function can also be seen as a black box: we pass an input (parameters), some internal processing occurs, and it produces an output (return value).
Functions allow us to segment our code into logical parts where each part performs a single action.</description></item><item><title>Flow Control</title><link>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0203-flow-control-structures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0203-flow-control-structures/</guid><description>Conditions: making decisions in code Life is full of decisions: &amp;ldquo;If it rains, I&amp;rsquo;ll take an umbrella. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll wear sunglasses.&amp;rdquo; These decisions are also present in the world of programming. Conditions are like questions the computer asks itself. They allow us to make decisions and execute specific code based on a condition1. They can be as simple as &amp;ldquo;Is it raining?&amp;rdquo; or as complex as &amp;ldquo;Is it the weekend and do I have less than $100 in my bank account?</description></item><item><title>Input and output operations</title><link>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0202-io-operations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0202-io-operations/</guid><description>Screen output Python also provides functions to send program output to &amp;ldquo;standard output&amp;rdquo;, usually the screen or terminal1.
The print() function displays the value passed as a parameter:
1name = &amp;#34;Eric&amp;#34; 2print(name) # displays &amp;#34;Eric&amp;#34; We can print multiple values separated by commas2:
1print(&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;, name, &amp;#34;!&amp;#34;) # displays &amp;#34;Hello Eric!&amp;#34; We can also use literal values without assigning to variables3:
1print(&amp;#34;2 + 3 =&amp;#34;, 2 + 3) # displays &amp;#34;2 + 3 = 5&amp;#34; Output formatting Python provides various ways to format output4:</description></item><item><title>Variables and Data Types</title><link>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0201-variables-data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0201-variables-data-types/</guid><description>Variables A variable is a container to store data in the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory. We can think of it as a box with a label. The label is the variable name and inside the box its value is stored.
To declare a variable in Python we just write the name and assign a value:
1age = 28 2price = 19.95 3student = True Variable names must start with letters or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.</description></item><item><title>Set Up your Development Environment</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</guid><description>Choosing a programming language Choosing a programming language is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in the learning process. Several factors to consider when selecting a language include:
Purpose: What do you want to code for? If it&amp;rsquo;s web development, JavaScript or PHP might be good options. If you&amp;rsquo;re into data science, R or Python might be more appropriate. Community: A language with an active community can be vital for beginners.</description></item><item><title>Boolean Logic</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0103-boolean-logic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0103-boolean-logic/</guid><description>Named in honour of George Boole, a 19th-century English mathematician, Boolean logic is a mathematical system that deals with operations resulting in one of two possible outcomes: true or false, typically represented as 1 and 0, respectively1. In his groundbreaking work, &amp;ldquo;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought,&amp;rdquo; Boole laid the foundations for this logic, introducing an algebraic system that could be employed to depict logical structures.
Boolean operations Within Boolean logic, several fundamental operations allow for the manipulation and combination of these binary expressions:</description></item><item><title>Numerical Systems</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</guid><description>The decimal system: the bedrock of our daily life From a tender age, we&amp;rsquo;re taught to count using ten digits: 0 through 9. This system, known as the decimal system, underpins almost all our mathematical and financial activities, from basic arithmetic to calculating bank interests1. Its roots trace back to our anatomy: the ten fingers on our hands, making it the most intuitive and natural system for us. Yet, its true charm emanates from its positional nature.</description></item><item><title>The Computer</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</guid><description>To the uninitiated, a computer might seem like a mere box—perhaps sometimes sleek and shiny—but a box nonetheless. Yet, within this &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; lies a universe of complexity and coordination.
Hardware represents the physical components of a computer: the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which is often likened to the brain of the system, the Random Access Memory (RAM) acting as a temporary storage while tasks are underway, storage devices that retain data, and peripherals like keyboards, mice, and monitors1.</description></item></channel></rss>
