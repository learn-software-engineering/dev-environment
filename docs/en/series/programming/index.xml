These concepts enable developers to write code that is more efficient, flexible, and maintainable. In this article, we will delve into some of these advanced concepts, including multithreading, generics/templates, reflection, serialization and deserialization, and dependency injection. Though we&amp;rsquo;ll provide Python examples where applicable, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that some of these concepts might be more prevalent in other programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Associations, aggregations, and compositions</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/07-associations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/07-associations/</guid><description>Understanding relationships between classes is vital for designing robust and maintainable systems. This article, will explore three types of relationships: Associations, Aggregations, and Compositions. We&amp;rsquo;ll look into their definitions, differences, and applications, providing examples in Python and using UML diagrams.
Definitions Association An association represents a “using” relationship between two or more objects. It indicates that objects of one class are somehow connected or utilize objects of another class.
Aggregation Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one class is a part of another class but both exist independently.</description></item><item><title>Abstraction</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/06-abstraction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/06-abstraction/</guid><description>Abstraction is one of the key principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It plays a vital role in managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what&amp;rsquo;s essential. This article, will explore the concept of abstraction, its purpose, abstract classes, interfaces, and implementation in Python.
Abstraction refers to the practice of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the essential parts. It&amp;rsquo;s like viewing something at a high level without delving into the details.</description></item><item><title>Polymorphism</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/05-polymorphism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/05-polymorphism/</guid><description>Polymorphism is a Greek word that means &amp;ldquo;many-shaped.&amp;rdquo; In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it&amp;rsquo;s a principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This principle enables greater flexibility and more dynamic behavior in code. This article, will delve into the concept of polymorphism, discussing its types, overloading, overriding, virtual functions, and providing examples in Python.
Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that&amp;rsquo;s specific to their individual types.</description></item><item><title>Inheritance</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/04-inheritance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/04-inheritance/</guid><description>Inheritance is another fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing for the creation of a new class based on an existing class. This concept helps in reusing code, creating relationships between classes, and building hierarchical structures. This article will explore inheritance in detail, focusing on examples in Python.
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (derived or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base or superclass). The derived class can extend or modify the features of the base class.</description></item><item><title>Encapsulation</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/03-encapsulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/03-encapsulation/</guid><description>Encapsulation is one of the four foundational principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It plays a crucial role in protecting the integrity of an object by controlling how its data can be accessed and modified. This article, will explore the concept of encapsulation, explain modifiers, and demonstrate how to use getters and setters in Python.
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, restricting direct access to some of an object&amp;rsquo;s components.</description></item><item><title>Classes and objects</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/02-classes-objects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/02-classes-objects/</guid><description>Building on our previous introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), this post will dive deeper into the core concepts of classes and objects. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore their definitions, how to create and use them, and discuss constructors and destructors, with examples in Python.
Definitions Classes A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of an object. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.

It&amp;rsquo;s built around the idea that everything can be represented as objects.
OOP emerged in the 1960s with the programming language Simula, but it gained prominence in the 1980s with languages like C++ and Smalltalk. At its core, OOP models the code as &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; that bundle both state (attributes) and behaviors (methods).</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</guid><description>Types of design patterns Creational patterns: are focused on the process of object creation, abstracting the instantiation process.
Structural patterns: are concerned with the composition of classes or objects, simplifying the structure and identifying relationships between objects.
Behavioral patterns: define ways for objects to communicate and interact, standardizing how objects cooperate.
Examples of design patterns Below are examples of three common design patterns implemented in Python.
Singleton pattern The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</guid><description>Why testing matters? Error Detection: Tests help identify errors and inconsistencies in code. Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that code meets certain quality standards. Refactoring Support: Tests provide a safety net for making changes to existing code. Documentation: Tests can serve as examples, illustrating how code is intended to be used. Types of testing Unit testing Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (or &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;) of code, like functions or methods.</description></item><item><title>Error Handling and Debugging</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</guid><description>Understanding errors In programming, errors are problems in the code that prevent it from running as intended. They can be categorized into:
Syntax Errors: Mistakes in the code&amp;rsquo;s structure, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation. Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as dividing by zero or accessing an element that does not exist. Logical Errors: Errors in the program&amp;rsquo;s logic that lead to unexpected results. Error handling Error handling is the process of detecting and managing errors in a program.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/04-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/04-algorithms/</guid><description>What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a precise sequence of instructions for processes that can be implemented in a programming language and executed by a computer. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example of an algorithm to find the largest number in a list.
1def find_largest(numbers): 2 largest = numbers[0] 3 for number in numbers: 4 if number &amp;gt; largest: 5 largest = number 6 return largest 7 8numbers = [34, 76, 23, 89, 12] 9print(find_largest(numbers)) # Output: 89 Types of algorithms Algorithms can be classified into various types, based on their structure, complexity, and purpose.</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and enable a high degree of code reusability.
Function declaration In Python, you declare a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses (). Inside the parentheses, you can include parameters.
1def greet(name): 2 print(f&amp;#34;Hello, {name}!&amp;#34;) Calling a function You can &amp;ldquo;call&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;invoke&amp;rdquo; a function by using its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments.</description></item><item><title>Control Flow</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</guid><description>Conditional statements Conditional statements are used to execute different code based on certain conditions.
If The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if that condition is True.
1x = 10 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) Else The else statement is used with an if statement to define code that will be executed if the condition is False.
1x = 3 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) 4else: 5 print(&amp;#34;x is not greater than 5&amp;#34;) Elif The elif (else if) statement allows you to check multiple conditions.</description></item><item><title>Variables and Data Types</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</guid><description>Variables A variable is like a container that stores a value. You can think of it as a label attached to a value, which allows you to reference that value later in your code. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign =.
1x = 10 Here, x is the variable name, and 10 is the value assigned to it.</description></item><item><title>Numerical systems and Boolean logic</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/03-numerical-systems-boolean-logic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/03-numerical-systems-boolean-logic/</guid><description>Binary numerical system The Binary system is a base-2 numerical system that uses only two symbols: \(0\) and \(1\) .

A computer consists of a central processing unit (CPU) and memory. The CPU is responsible for executing instructions, while memory stores data and instructions. Programs are a set of instructions that are stored in memory and executed by the CPU. These instructions tell the computer what to do, such as performing calculations, displaying information on a screen, or interacting with other devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
