In his groundbreaking work, &amp;ldquo;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought,&amp;rdquo; Boole laid the foundations for this logic, introducing an algebraic system that could be employed to depict logical structures.
Boolean operations Within Boolean logic, several fundamental operations allow for the manipulation and combination of these binary expressions:</description></item><item><title>Numerical systems</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</guid><description>The decimal system: the bedrock of our daily life From a tender age, we&amp;rsquo;re taught to count using ten digits: 0 through 9. This system, known as the decimal system, underpins almost all our mathematical and financial activities, from basic arithmetic to calculating bank interests1. Its roots trace back to our anatomy: the ten fingers on our hands, making it the most intuitive and natural system for us. Yet, its true charm emanates from its positional nature.</description></item><item><title>The essence of computers</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</guid><description>To the uninitiated, a computer might seem like a mere box—perhaps sometimes sleek and shiny—but a box nonetheless. Yet, within this &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; lies a universe of complexity and coordination.
Hardware represents the physical components of a computer: the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which is often likened to the brain of the system, the Random Access Memory (RAM) acting as a temporary storage while tasks are underway, storage devices that retain data, and peripherals like keyboards, mice, and monitors1.</description></item><item><title>The Deployment phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/06-deployment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/06-deployment/</guid><description>The main goals of the deployment stage are:
Install and configure the software on production infrastructure. Migrate data from old systems if needed. Run integration, performance, and security tests. Release the software for use by end users. Proper deployment is critical for delivering high quality software that meets customer needs. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment stage, best practices, challenges, and key steps involved.
The deployment environment is usually separate from the development environment and mirrors the actual production infrastructure as closely as possible.</description></item><item><title>The Maintenance phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</guid><description>This phase ensures that software remains robust, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifecycle1.
Software maintenance encompasses all activities post-deployment that are not categorized as software evolution2. It&amp;rsquo;s about refining, enhancing, and optimizing software, as well as fixing errors that surface over time.
While creating software is challenging, maintaining it is often even more demanding. With changing user needs, technology advancements, and the inevitable emergence of bugs, ongoing maintenance is essential for software&amp;rsquo;s continued relevance and efficiency1.</description></item><item><title>The Testing phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</guid><description>Software testing, at its core, is an activity where software undergoes various forms of evaluation. It’s conducted to ensure that the software adheres to specified requirements and doesn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate unwanted behaviors1. It is a meticulous blend of logic and creativity: logic to methodically navigate predefined paths and creativity to anticipate unexpected scenarios and user behaviors.
Before diving into its components, let&amp;rsquo;s recognize the non-negotiable importance of testing in the SDLC.</description></item><item><title>The Implementation phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</guid><description>The implementation stage holds special significance as it transitions the project from concept to reality1. At its core, it involves the actual coding of the software. After meticulous planning and thorough design, this phase breathes life into the application, constructing the features and functionalities the end-users will eventually interact with2.
Key components The implementation phase is an intricate mesh of various components, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring the resulting software is robust, efficient, and meets user requirements.</description></item><item><title>The System Design phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the stage where we transition from understanding what the software should do (requirements) to how it will achieve this1. It provides the architectural blueprints for the software, establishing the foundation upon which code is written, databases are structured, and systems communicate. It&amp;rsquo;s a vital roadmap for developers, ensuring everyone understands and aligns on how the system will operate.
System design typically breaks down into two sub-categories:
High-Level design (HLD): think of this as the macro view.</description></item><item><title>The Planning phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</guid><description>At its core, planning in software development is about establishing a clear vision for the software project, determining what you want to achieve, and figuring out how best to achieve it1. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to mapping out a journey before embarking on it, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and knowledge to navigate through the challenges ahead.
Key components Requirement gathering and analysis When we talk about requirements, we&amp;rsquo;re essentially discussing the needs, desires, and constraints of the software project1.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/01-introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/01-introduction/</guid><description>The SDLC is a framework encompassing the tasks required for the entire software development process. It serves as a structured guide used by professionals to design, develop, and test high-quality software, ensuring the final product aligns with customer expectations, is delivered timely, and remains within budget1. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to note that while the SDLC provides a foundational structure, its actual implementation can vary based on the chosen development methodology, be it Waterfall, Agile, or others.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0100-intro/01-intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0100-intro/01-intro/</guid><description>What is Software? Several thought leaders in the world of computing have defined software in various ways:
Ian Sommerville1: Computer programs and associated documentation.
Roger S. Pressman2: A collection of computer programs, procedures, rules, and associated documentation and data.
Andrew S. Tanenbaum3: A series of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
Grady Booch4: Set of items or objects that form a configuration that includes programs, documents, and data.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/01-intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/01-intro/</guid><description>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that helps organize code using real-world concepts, making it more readable, reusable, and maintainable. It&amp;rsquo;s built around the idea that everything can be represented as objects.
OOP emerged in the 1960s with the programming language Simula, but it gained prominence in the 1980s with languages like C++ and Smalltalk. At its core, OOP models the code as &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; that bundle both state (attributes) and behaviors (methods).</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</guid><description>Types of design patterns Creational patterns: are focused on the process of object creation, abstracting the instantiation process.
Structural patterns: are concerned with the composition of classes or objects, simplifying the structure and identifying relationships between objects.
Behavioral patterns: define ways for objects to communicate and interact, standardizing how objects cooperate.
Examples of design patterns Below are examples of three common design patterns implemented in Python.
Singleton pattern The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</guid><description>Why testing matters? Error Detection: Tests help identify errors and inconsistencies in code. Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that code meets certain quality standards. Refactoring Support: Tests provide a safety net for making changes to existing code. Documentation: Tests can serve as examples, illustrating how code is intended to be used. Types of testing Unit testing Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (or &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;) of code, like functions or methods.</description></item><item><title>Error Handling and Debugging</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</guid><description>Understanding errors In programming, errors are problems in the code that prevent it from running as intended. They can be categorized into:
Syntax Errors: Mistakes in the code&amp;rsquo;s structure, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation. Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as dividing by zero or accessing an element that does not exist. Logical Errors: Errors in the program&amp;rsquo;s logic that lead to unexpected results. Error handling Error handling is the process of detecting and managing errors in a program.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/04-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/04-algorithms/</guid><description>What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a precise sequence of instructions for processes that can be implemented in a programming language and executed by a computer. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example of an algorithm to find the largest number in a list.
1def find_largest(numbers): 2 largest = numbers[0] 3 for number in numbers: 4 if number &amp;gt; largest: 5 largest = number 6 return largest 7 8numbers = [34, 76, 23, 89, 12] 9print(find_largest(numbers)) # Output: 89 Types of algorithms Algorithms can be classified into various types, based on their structure, complexity, and purpose.</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and enable a high degree of code reusability.
Function declaration In Python, you declare a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses (). Inside the parentheses, you can include parameters.
1def greet(name): 2 print(f&amp;#34;Hello, {name}!&amp;#34;) Calling a function You can &amp;ldquo;call&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;invoke&amp;rdquo; a function by using its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments.</description></item><item><title>Control Flow</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</guid><description>Conditional statements Conditional statements are used to execute different code based on certain conditions.
If The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if that condition is True.
1x = 10 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) Else The else statement is used with an if statement to define code that will be executed if the condition is False.
1x = 3 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) 4else: 5 print(&amp;#34;x is not greater than 5&amp;#34;) Elif The elif (else if) statement allows you to check multiple conditions.</description></item><item><title>Variables and Data Types</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</guid><description>Variables A variable is like a container that stores a value. You can think of it as a label attached to a value, which allows you to reference that value later in your code. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign =.
1x = 10 Here, x is the variable name, and 10 is the value assigned to it.</description></item><item><title>Set up your development environment</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</guid><description>Choosing a programming language Choosing a programming language is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in the learning process. Several factors to consider when selecting a language include:
Purpose: What do you want to code for? If it&amp;rsquo;s web development, JavaScript or PHP might be good options. If you&amp;rsquo;re into data science, R or Python might be more appropriate. Community: A language with an active community can be vital for beginners.</description></item></channel></rss>
