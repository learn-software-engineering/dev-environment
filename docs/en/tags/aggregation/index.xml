This article, will explore three types of relationships: Associations, Aggregations, and Compositions. We&amp;rsquo;ll look into their definitions, differences, and applications, providing examples in Python and using UML diagrams.
Definitions Association An association represents a “using” relationship between two or more objects. It indicates that objects of one class are somehow connected or utilize objects of another class.
Aggregation Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one class is a part of another class but both exist independently.</description></item></channel></rss>
