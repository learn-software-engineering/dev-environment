Recursion in programming is something similar. It is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly1. This creates a cycle where the function solves a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem, until reaching a simple base case that can be solved directly.</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0204-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-starting-concepts/0204-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function, in simple terms, is a block of code that executes only when called. You can think of it as a small program within your main program, designed to perform a specific task1. A function can also be seen as a black box: we pass an input (parameters), some internal processing occurs, and it produces an output (return value).
Functions allow us to segment our code into logical parts where each part performs a single action.</description></item></channel></rss>
