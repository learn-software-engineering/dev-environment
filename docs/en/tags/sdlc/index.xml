&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install and configure the software on production infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Migrate data from old systems if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run integration, performance, and security tests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Release the software for use by end users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Proper deployment is critical for delivering high quality software that meets customer needs. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment stage, best practices, challenges, and key steps involved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The deployment environment is usually separate from the development environment and mirrors the actual production infrastructure as closely as possible. Thorough testing in this stage helps minimize issues when releasing to production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Maintenance phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</guid><description>&lt;p>This phase ensures that software remains robust, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifecycle&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software maintenance encompasses all activities post-deployment that are not categorized as software evolution&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It&amp;rsquo;s about refining, enhancing, and optimizing software, as well as fixing errors that surface over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While creating software is challenging, maintaining it is often even more demanding. With changing user needs, technology advancements, and the inevitable emergence of bugs, ongoing maintenance is essential for software&amp;rsquo;s continued relevance and efficiency&lt;sup id="fnref1:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Testing phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Software testing, at its core, is an activity where software undergoes various forms of evaluation. It’s conducted to ensure that the software adheres to specified requirements and doesn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate unwanted behaviours&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It is a meticulous blend of logic and creativity: logic to methodically navigate predefined paths and creativity to anticipate unexpected scenarios and user behaviours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before diving into its components, let&amp;rsquo;s recognize the non-negotiable importance of testing in the SDLC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Implementation phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</guid><description>&lt;p>The implementation stage holds special significance as it transitions the project from concept to reality&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. At its core, it involves the actual coding of the software. After meticulous planning and thorough design, this phase breathes life into the application, constructing the features and functionalities the end-users will eventually interact with&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="key-components">Key components&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The implementation phase is an intricate mesh of various components, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring the resulting software is robust, efficient, and meets user requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The System Design phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the stage where we transition from understanding what the software should do (requirements) to how it will achieve this&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It provides the architectural blueprints for the software, establishing the foundation upon which code is written, databases are structured, and systems communicate. It&amp;rsquo;s a vital roadmap for developers, ensuring everyone understands and aligns on how the system will operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>System design typically breaks down into two sub-categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>High-Level design (HLD)&lt;/strong>: think of this as the macro view. It focuses on system architecture, representing the main components, their relationships, and interactions&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It’s where we decide on the software&amp;rsquo;s major structural elements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Planning phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</guid><description>&lt;p>At its core, planning in software development is about establishing a clear vision for the software project, determining what you want to achieve, and figuring out how best to achieve it&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to mapping out a journey before embarking on it, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and knowledge to navigate through the challenges ahead.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="key-components">Key components&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="requirement-gathering-and-analysis">Requirement gathering and analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we talk about requirements, we&amp;rsquo;re essentially discussing the needs, desires, and constraints of the software project&lt;sup id="fnref1:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Requirement gathering is the act of deeply engaging with stakeholders, from potential users to business experts, to compile a comprehensive list of what the software must accomplish. This dialogue can take various forms: interviews, surveys, user workshops, or even observation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/01-introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/01-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>The SDLC is a framework encompassing the tasks required for the entire software development process. It serves as a structured guide used by professionals to design, develop, and test high-quality software, ensuring the final product aligns with customer expectations, is delivered timely, and remains within budget&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to note that while the SDLC provides a foundational structure, its actual implementation can vary based on the chosen development methodology, be it Waterfall, Agile, or others.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
