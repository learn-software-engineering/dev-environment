This is precisely what we seek to achieve - &amp;ldquo;packaging&amp;rdquo; data and code within a single capsule (the class) to hide its internal complexity.
The formal definition would be:
&amp;ldquo;Encapsulation refers to bundling data and functions that manipulate these data into a single entity or software module.&amp;rdquo;1
That is, keeping related data and behaviours together in order to restrict direct access to that data from other parts of the programme, interacting only through a controlled interface (public API).</description></item><item><title>Classes and objects</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/0301-classes-objects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/0301-classes-objects/</guid><description>Anatomy of a class A class acts as a blueprint or mould to construct similar objects, defining their common characteristics and functionalities. It is similar to the blueprint used to construct houses in the same neighbourhood: they all share certain key attributes.
The typical components of a class are:
Attributes (properties): Variables that characterise the object. For example, for a Person class, attributes like name, age, ID, etc.
1class Person: 2 id = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; 3 name = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; 4 age = 0 Methods: Functions that define behaviours.</description></item></channel></rss>
