Install and configure the software on production infrastructure. Migrate data from old systems if needed. Run integration, performance, and security tests. Release the software for use by end users. Proper deployment is critical for delivering high quality software that meets customer needs. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment stage, best practices, challenges, and key steps involved.
The deployment environment is usually separate from the development environment and mirrors the actual production infrastructure as closely as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
