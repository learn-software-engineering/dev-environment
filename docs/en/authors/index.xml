My entire career has been driven by an insatiable curiosity for software engineering practices and a relentless pursuit of ways to refine the development process. My journey has seen me wear many hats, including those of a Software Developer, Configuration Manager, Scrum Master, DevOps Engineer, DevOps Consultant, and Platform Engineer.
What truly fuels my passion is not just the act of learning, but also the joy of sharing knowledge.</description></item><item><title>María Florencia Caro</title><link>/en/authors/mfcaro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/authors/mfcaro/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
