Error Detection: Tests help identify errors and inconsistencies in code. Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that code meets certain quality standards. Refactoring Support: Tests provide a safety net for making changes to existing code. Documentation: Tests can serve as examples, illustrating how code is intended to be used. Types of testing Unit testing Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (or &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;) of code, like functions or methods.</description></item><item><title>Error Handling and Debugging</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</guid><description>Understanding errors In programming, errors are problems in the code that prevent it from running as intended. They can be categorized into:
Syntax Errors: Mistakes in the code&amp;rsquo;s structure, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation. Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as dividing by zero or accessing an element that does not exist. Logical Errors: Errors in the program&amp;rsquo;s logic that lead to unexpected results. Error handling Error handling is the process of detecting and managing errors in a program.</description></item></channel></rss>
