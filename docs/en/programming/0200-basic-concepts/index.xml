Recursion in programming is something similar. It is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly1. This creates a cycle where the function solves a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem, until reaching a simple base case that can be solved directly.</description></item><item><title>Control Flow</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0203-control-flow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0203-control-flow/</guid><description>Conditions: making decisions in code Life is full of decisions: &amp;ldquo;If it rains, I&amp;rsquo;ll take an umbrella. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll wear sunglasses.&amp;rdquo; These decisions are also present in the world of programming. Conditions are like questions the computer asks itself. They allow us to make decisions and execute specific code based on a condition1. They can be as simple as &amp;ldquo;Is it raining?&amp;rdquo; or as complex as &amp;ldquo;Is it the weekend and do I have less than $100 in my bank account?</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0204-functions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0204-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function, in simple terms, is a block of code that executes only when called. You can think of it as a small program within your main program, designed to perform a specific task1. A function can also be seen as a black box: we pass an input (parameters), some internal processing occurs, and it produces an output (return value).
Functions allow us to segment our code into logical parts where each part performs a single action.</description></item><item><title>Input and output operations</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0202-io-operations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0202-io-operations/</guid><description>Keyboard input Python provides built-in functions to read data entered by the user at runtime. This is known as &amp;ldquo;standard input&amp;rdquo; (Downey, 2015).
The input() function allows reading a value entered by the user and assigning it to a variable. For example:
1name = input(&amp;#34;Enter your name: &amp;#34;) This displays the message &amp;ldquo;Enter your name: &amp;quot; and waits for the user to enter text and press Enter. That value is assigned to the name variable (Lutz, 2013).</description></item><item><title>Variables and Data Types</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0201-variables-data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/0201-variables-data-types/</guid><description>Variables A variable is a container to store data in the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory. We can think of it as a box with a label. The label is the variable name and inside the box its value is stored.
To declare a variable in Python we just write the name and assign a value:
1age = 28 2price = 19.95 3student = True Variable names must start with letters or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.</description></item></channel></rss>
