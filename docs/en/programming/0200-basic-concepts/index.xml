An algorithm is a precise sequence of instructions for processes that can be implemented in a programming language and executed by a computer. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example of an algorithm to find the largest number in a list.
1def find_largest(numbers): 2 largest = numbers[0] 3 for number in numbers: 4 if number &amp;gt; largest: 5 largest = number 6 return largest 7 8numbers = [34, 76, 23, 89, 12] 9print(find_largest(numbers)) # Output: 89 Types of algorithms Algorithms can be classified into various types, based on their structure, complexity, and purpose.</description></item><item><title>Functions</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/03-functions/</guid><description>What are functions? A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and enable a high degree of code reusability.
Function declaration In Python, you declare a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses (). Inside the parentheses, you can include parameters.
1def greet(name): 2 print(f&amp;#34;Hello, {name}!&amp;#34;) Calling a function You can &amp;ldquo;call&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;invoke&amp;rdquo; a function by using its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments.</description></item><item><title>Control Flow</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/02-control-flow/</guid><description>Conditional statements Conditional statements are used to execute different code based on certain conditions.
If The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if that condition is True.
1x = 10 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) Else The else statement is used with an if statement to define code that will be executed if the condition is False.
1x = 3 2if x &amp;gt; 5: 3 print(&amp;#34;x is greater than 5&amp;#34;) 4else: 5 print(&amp;#34;x is not greater than 5&amp;#34;) Elif The elif (else if) statement allows you to check multiple conditions.</description></item><item><title>Variables and Data Types</title><link>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0200-basic-concepts/01-variables-data-types/</guid><description>Variables A variable is like a container that stores a value. You can think of it as a label attached to a value, which allows you to reference that value later in your code. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign =.
1x = 10 Here, x is the variable name, and 10 is the value assigned to it.</description></item></channel></rss>
