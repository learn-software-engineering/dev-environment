&lt;h2 id="choosing-a-programming-language">Choosing a programming language&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Choosing a programming language is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in the learning process. Several factors to consider when selecting a language include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: What do you want to code for? If it&amp;rsquo;s web development, JavaScript or PHP might be good options. If you&amp;rsquo;re into data science, R or Python might be more appropriate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community&lt;/strong>: A language with an active community can be vital for beginners. A vibrant community usually means more resources, tutorials, and solutions available online.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Learning curve&lt;/strong>: Some languages are easier to pick up than others. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to pick one that matches your experience level and patience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job opportunities&lt;/strong>: If you&amp;rsquo;re eyeing a career in programming, researching the job market demand for various languages can be insightful.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>While there are many valuable and potent languages, for the purpose of this course, we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen &lt;a
 href="https://www.python.org/"
 
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. This language is renowned for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for those just starting out. Moreover, Python boasts an active community and a wide range of applications, from web development to artificial intelligence&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boolean Logic</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0103-boolean-logic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0103-boolean-logic/</guid><description>&lt;p>Named in honour of &lt;a

 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Boole&lt;/a>, a 19th-century English mathematician, Boolean logic is a mathematical system that deals with operations resulting in one of two possible outcomes: true or false, typically represented as 1 and 0, respectively&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. In his groundbreaking work, &amp;ldquo;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought,&amp;rdquo; Boole laid the foundations for this logic, introducing an algebraic system that could be employed to depict logical structures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical Systems</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-decimal-system-the-bedrock-of-our-daily-life">The decimal system: the bedrock of our daily life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>From a tender age, we&amp;rsquo;re taught to count using ten digits: 0 through 9. This system, known as the decimal system, underpins almost all our mathematical and financial activities, from basic arithmetic to calculating bank interests&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Its roots trace back to our anatomy: the ten fingers on our hands, making it the most intuitive and natural system for us. Yet, its true charm emanates from its positional nature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Computer</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</guid><description>&lt;p>To the uninitiated, a computer might seem like a mere box—perhaps sometimes sleek and shiny—but a box nonetheless. Yet, within this &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>box&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; lies a universe of complexity and coordination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Hardware&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> represents the physical components of a computer: the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which is often likened to the brain of the system, the Random Access Memory (RAM) acting as a temporary storage while tasks are underway, storage devices that retain data, and peripherals like keyboards, mice, and monitors&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
