A computer consists of a central processing unit (CPU) and memory. The CPU is responsible for executing instructions, while memory stores data and instructions. Programs are a set of instructions that are stored in memory and executed by the CPU. These instructions tell the computer what to do, such as performing calculations, displaying information on a screen, or interacting with other devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
