In his groundbreaking work, &amp;ldquo;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought,&amp;rdquo; Boole laid the foundations for this logic, introducing an algebraic system that could be employed to depict logical structures.
Boolean operations Within Boolean logic, several fundamental operations allow for the manipulation and combination of these binary expressions:</description></item><item><title>Numerical systems</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0102-numerical-systems/</guid><description>The decimal system: the bedrock of our daily life From a tender age, we&amp;rsquo;re taught to count using ten digits: 0 through 9. This system, known as the decimal system, underpins almost all our mathematical and financial activities, from basic arithmetic to calculating bank interests1. Its roots trace back to our anatomy: the ten fingers on our hands, making it the most intuitive and natural system for us. Yet, its true charm emanates from its positional nature.</description></item><item><title>The essence of computers</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0101-computers/</guid><description>To the uninitiated, a computer might seem like a mere box—perhaps sometimes sleek and shiny—but a box nonetheless. Yet, within this &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; lies a universe of complexity and coordination.
Hardware represents the physical components of a computer: the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which is often likened to the brain of the system, the Random Access Memory (RAM) acting as a temporary storage while tasks are underway, storage devices that retain data, and peripherals like keyboards, mice, and monitors1.</description></item><item><title>Set up your development environment</title><link>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0100-intro/0104-setup-dev-environment/</guid><description>Choosing a programming language Choosing a programming language is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in the learning process. Several factors to consider when selecting a language include:
Purpose: What do you want to code for? If it&amp;rsquo;s web development, JavaScript or PHP might be good options. If you&amp;rsquo;re into data science, R or Python might be more appropriate. Community: A language with an active community can be vital for beginners.</description></item></channel></rss>
