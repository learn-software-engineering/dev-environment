Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
According to Martin Fowler2, a project is truly embracing Continuous Delivery when:
The software can be deployed at any stage of its lifecycle. The team values keeping the software deployment-ready over adding new features. Any software version can be deployed to any environment on-demand.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration</title><link>/en/blog/2023/08/continuous-integration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/2023/08/continuous-integration/</guid><description>One of the most pivotal challenges in the realm of software development is effectively integrating changes 1. In a small-scale project steered by a single developer, this challenge might appear to be trivial. However, as the magnitude of the project escalates and more individuals join the development fold, the significance of seamless integration becomes paramount.
Historically, integration was often an afterthought, relegated to the tail end of the software development process 2.</description></item><item><title>Requirements Engineering</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0300-requirements-engineering/01-requirements-engineering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0300-requirements-engineering/01-requirements-engineering/</guid><description>According to Sommerville and Sawyer, a requirement is a statement about an intended product that specifies what it should do or how it should perform1.
Requirements identify the goals, needs and constraints that the software must address in order to deliver value. They are a form of specification that serve as the foundation for all subsequent software engineering activities.
Some key definitions of requirements are:

Proper deployment is critical for delivering high quality software that meets customer needs. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment stage, best practices, challenges, and key steps involved.
The deployment environment is usually separate from the development environment and mirrors the actual production infrastructure as closely as possible.</description></item><item><title>The Maintenance phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/07-maintenance/</guid><description>This phase ensures that software remains robust, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifecycle1.
Software maintenance encompasses all activities post-deployment that are not categorized as software evolution2. It&amp;rsquo;s about refining, enhancing, and optimizing software, as well as fixing errors that surface over time.
While creating software is challenging, maintaining it is often even more demanding. With changing user needs, technology advancements, and the inevitable emergence of bugs, ongoing maintenance is essential for software&amp;rsquo;s continued relevance and efficiency1.</description></item><item><title>The Testing phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/05-testing/</guid><description>Software testing, at its core, is an activity where software undergoes various forms of evaluation. It’s conducted to ensure that the software adheres to specified requirements and doesn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate unwanted behaviors1. It is a meticulous blend of logic and creativity: logic to methodically navigate predefined paths and creativity to anticipate unexpected scenarios and user behaviors.
Before diving into its components, let&amp;rsquo;s recognize the non-negotiable importance of testing in the SDLC.</description></item><item><title>The Implementation phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/04-implementation/</guid><description>The implementation stage holds special significance as it transitions the project from concept to reality1. At its core, it involves the actual coding of the software. After meticulous planning and thorough design, this phase breathes life into the application, constructing the features and functionalities the end-users will eventually interact with2.
Key components The implementation phase is an intricate mesh of various components, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring the resulting software is robust, efficient, and meets user requirements.</description></item><item><title>The System Design phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/03-system-design/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the stage where we transition from understanding what the software should do (requirements) to how it will achieve this1. It provides the architectural blueprints for the software, establishing the foundation upon which code is written, databases are structured, and systems communicate. It&amp;rsquo;s a vital roadmap for developers, ensuring everyone understands and aligns on how the system will operate.
System design typically breaks down into two sub-categories:
High-Level design (HLD): think of this as the macro view.</description></item><item><title>The Planning phase</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0200-sdlc/02-planning/</guid><description>At its core, planning in software development is about establishing a clear vision for the software project, determining what you want to achieve, and figuring out how best to achieve it1. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to mapping out a journey before embarking on it, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and knowledge to navigate through the challenges ahead.

It serves as a structured guide used by professionals to design, develop, and test high-quality software, ensuring the final product aligns with customer expectations, is delivered timely, and remains within budget1. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to note that while the SDLC provides a foundational structure, its actual implementation can vary based on the chosen development methodology, be it Waterfall, Agile, or others.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/software-engineering/0100-intro/01-intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/software-engineering/0100-intro/01-intro/</guid><description>What is Software? Several thought leaders in the world of computing have defined software in various ways:
Ian Sommerville1: Computer programs and associated documentation.
Roger S. Pressman2: A collection of computer programs, procedures, rules, and associated documentation and data.
Andrew S. Tanenbaum3: A series of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
Grady Booch4: Set of items or objects that form a configuration that includes programs, documents, and data.</description></item><item><title>Recursive functions</title><link>/en/blog/2023/08/recursive-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/2023/08/recursive-functions/</guid><description>A recursive function breaks down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. These subproblems are solved by the same function, which continues to call itself until it reaches a base case.
The factorial function is a great example to demonstrate recursion. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down step by step.
The factorial of a positive integer \(n\) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \(n\) . For example:</description></item><item><title>Advanced concepts</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/08-advanced-concepts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/08-advanced-concepts/</guid><description>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has many advanced concepts that take the programming paradigm to a higher level. These concepts enable developers to write code that is more efficient, flexible, and maintainable. In this article, we will delve into some of these advanced concepts, including multithreading, generics/templates, reflection, serialization and deserialization, and dependency injection. Though we&amp;rsquo;ll provide Python examples where applicable, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that some of these concepts might be more prevalent in other programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Associations, aggregations, and compositions</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/07-associations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/07-associations/</guid><description>Understanding relationships between classes is vital for designing robust and maintainable systems. This article, will explore three types of relationships: Associations, Aggregations, and Compositions. We&amp;rsquo;ll look into their definitions, differences, and applications, providing examples in Python and using UML diagrams.
Definitions Association An association represents a “using” relationship between two or more objects. It indicates that objects of one class are somehow connected or utilize objects of another class.
Aggregation Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one class is a part of another class but both exist independently.</description></item><item><title>Abstraction</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/06-abstraction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/06-abstraction/</guid><description>Abstraction is one of the key principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It plays a vital role in managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what&amp;rsquo;s essential. This article, will explore the concept of abstraction, its purpose, abstract classes, interfaces, and implementation in Python.
Abstraction refers to the practice of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the essential parts. It&amp;rsquo;s like viewing something at a high level without delving into the details.</description></item><item><title>Polymorphism</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/05-polymorphism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/05-polymorphism/</guid><description>Polymorphism is a Greek word that means &amp;ldquo;many-shaped.&amp;rdquo; In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it&amp;rsquo;s a principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This principle enables greater flexibility and more dynamic behavior in code. This article, will delve into the concept of polymorphism, discussing its types, overloading, overriding, virtual functions, and providing examples in Python.
Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that&amp;rsquo;s specific to their individual types.</description></item><item><title>Inheritance</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/04-inheritance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/04-inheritance/</guid><description>Inheritance is another fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing for the creation of a new class based on an existing class. This concept helps in reusing code, creating relationships between classes, and building hierarchical structures. This article will explore inheritance in detail, focusing on examples in Python.
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (derived or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base or superclass). The derived class can extend or modify the features of the base class.</description></item><item><title>Encapsulation</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/03-encapsulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/03-encapsulation/</guid><description>Encapsulation is one of the four foundational principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It plays a crucial role in protecting the integrity of an object by controlling how its data can be accessed and modified. This article, will explore the concept of encapsulation, explain modifiers, and demonstrate how to use getters and setters in Python.
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, restricting direct access to some of an object&amp;rsquo;s components.</description></item><item><title>Classes and objects</title><link>/en/programming/0300-oop/02-classes-objects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0300-oop/02-classes-objects/</guid><description>Building on our previous introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), this post will dive deeper into the core concepts of classes and objects. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore their definitions, how to create and use them, and discuss constructors and destructors, with examples in Python.
Definitions Classes A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of an object. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.

It&amp;rsquo;s built around the idea that everything can be represented as objects.
OOP emerged in the 1960s with the programming language Simula, but it gained prominence in the 1980s with languages like C++ and Smalltalk. At its core, OOP models the code as &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; that bundle both state (attributes) and behaviors (methods).</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0500-design-patterns/01-introduction/</guid><description>Types of design patterns Creational patterns: are focused on the process of object creation, abstracting the instantiation process.
Structural patterns: are concerned with the composition of classes or objects, simplifying the structure and identifying relationships between objects.
Behavioral patterns: define ways for objects to communicate and interact, standardizing how objects cooperate.
Examples of design patterns Below are examples of three common design patterns implemented in Python.
Singleton pattern The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/02-testing/</guid><description>Why testing matters? Error Detection: Tests help identify errors and inconsistencies in code. Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that code meets certain quality standards. Refactoring Support: Tests provide a safety net for making changes to existing code. Documentation: Tests can serve as examples, illustrating how code is intended to be used. Types of testing Unit testing Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (or &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;) of code, like functions or methods.</description></item><item><title>Error Handling and Debugging</title><link>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/programming/0400-testing/01-error-handling-debugging/</guid><description>Understanding errors In programming, errors are problems in the code that prevent it from running as intended. They can be categorized into:
Syntax Errors: Mistakes in the code&amp;rsquo;s structure, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation. Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as dividing by zero or accessing an element that does not exist. Logical Errors: Errors in the program&amp;rsquo;s logic that lead to unexpected results.
