Although there are several options for git reset the most used are:
--soft: Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to , just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files &amp;ldquo;Changes to be committed&amp;rdquo;, as git status would put it.</description></item><item><title>Revert a pushed change in Git</title><link>https://learn-software.com/posts/git-revert-pushed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn-software.com/posts/git-revert-pushed/</guid><description>When we realized that the last commit was a mistake but we already published it, the command to use is git revert &amp;lt;COMMIT_HASH&amp;gt;.
First we need to locate the ID of the commit we want to revert, it can be done with git log or git reflog commands. Then, run the git revert &amp;lt;COMMIT_HASH&amp;gt; command using the ID obtained in the previous step. Use the options -e or --edit to edit the commit message if we like.</description></item></channel></rss>
