Among these phases, the implementation stage holds special significance as it transitions the project from concept to reality[^1]. In this stage, abstract designs materialize into tangible lines of code, giving birth to the software&amp;rsquo;s functional attributes.
At its core, the implementation stage involves the actual coding of the software. After meticulous planning and thorough design, this phase breathes life into the application, constructing the features and functionalities the end-users will eventually interact with[^2].</description></item></channel></rss>
