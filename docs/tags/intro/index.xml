It is the backbone of modern technology and is used in a wide range of fields, from finance and healthcare to gaming and entertainment. Whether you are building a website, an app, or a complex piece of software, programming is at the core of it all.
Before diving into programming, it is important to understand some basic concepts about how computers work.</description></item><item><title>Installing Python</title><link>/posts/programming-basics/02-installing-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/programming-basics/02-installing-python/</guid><description>Python is a widely-used programming language for web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and much more. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through the installation process of Python on three major operating systems: Linux, Mac, and Windows.
Since Python is often pre-installed on many Linux and Mac systems, this guide also covers checking your existing version and upgrading if necessary.
Linux Check Existing Version: Many Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed.</description></item><item><title>Numerical systems and Boolean logic</title><link>/posts/programming-basics/03-numerical-systems-boolean-logic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/programming-basics/03-numerical-systems-boolean-logic/</guid><description>Programming, at its core, involves manipulating numbers and logic. In this article, we will explore two essential numerical systems (Binary and Hexadecimal) and delve into the fundamental principles of Boolean logic. These concepts are vital for anyone beginning their journey in programming.
Binary numerical system The Binary system is a base-2 numerical system that uses only two symbols: $0$ and $1$. It&amp;rsquo;s the fundamental language of computers and is used to represent all types of data.</description></item></channel></rss>
