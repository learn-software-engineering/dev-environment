&lt;p>A function, in simple terms, is a block of code that executes only when called. You can think of it as a small program within your main program, designed to perform a specific task. A function can also be seen as a black box: we pass an input (parameters), some internal processing occurs, and it produces an output (return value).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Functions allow us to segment our code into logical parts where each part performs a single action. This provides several benefits:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Recursive Functions</title><link>/programming/starting-concepts/recursive-functions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/programming/starting-concepts/recursive-functions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="recursion-the-art-of-calling-yourself">Recursion: the art of calling yourself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Imagine a box of mirrors where each mirror reflects what it sees in the next, creating an infinite series of reflections. Recursion in programming is something similar. It is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. This creates a cycle where the function solves a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem, until reaching a simple base case that can be solved directly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
