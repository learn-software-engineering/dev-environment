It&amp;rsquo;s the stage where we transition from understanding what the software should do (requirements) to how it will achieve this1. In many ways, this phase sets the stage for the eventual construction of the software system.
It provides the architectural blueprints for the software, establishing the foundation upon which code is written, databases are structured, and systems communicate.</description></item><item><title>SDLC: The Deployment phase</title><link>https://learn-software.com/posts/software-engineering/07-sldc-deployment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn-software.com/posts/software-engineering/07-sldc-deployment/</guid><description>The deployment stage involves releasing the software into production and making it available for end users. The main goals of the deployment stage are:
Install and configure the software on production infrastructure. Migrate data from old systems if needed. Run integration, performance, and security tests. Release the software for use by end users. Proper deployment is critical for delivering high quality software that meets customer needs. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment stage, best practices, challenges, and key steps involved.</description></item></channel></rss>
