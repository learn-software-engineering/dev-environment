&lt;p>Life is full of decisions: &amp;ldquo;If it rains, I&amp;rsquo;ll take an umbrella. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll wear sunglasses.&amp;rdquo; These decisions are also present in the world of programming. Conditions are like questions the computer asks itself. They allow us to make decisions and execute specific code based on a condition. They can be as simple as &amp;ldquo;Is it raining?&amp;rdquo; or as complex as &amp;ldquo;Is it the weekend and do I have less than $100 in my bank account?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
