However, before that milestone can be reached, a rigorous evaluation must ensure the software is robust, user-friendly, and aligns with specified requirements. The torchbearer of this assessment? The testing stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Dive with me into this crucial phase and fathom its depth and expanse.
Software testing, at its core, is an activity where software undergoes various forms of evaluation.</description></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>/posts/programming-basics/10-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/programming-basics/10-testing/</guid><description>Testing is the practice of running code to check if it behaves as expected. It helps find errors, ensures reliability, and maintains code quality. This article provides an introduction to testing, focusing on examples in Python but also describing general principles applicable to other programming languages.
Why testing matters Error Detection: Tests help identify errors and inconsistencies in code. Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that code meets certain quality standards. Refactoring Support: Tests provide a safety net for making changes to existing code.</description></item></channel></rss>
