# Input and output operations

Input/output operations (I/O) allow a program to communicate and exchange data with the outside world. In this article we will see in detail input operations from the keyboard or a file, and output to the screen or a file.

## Screen output

Python provides functions to send program output to *"standard output"*, usually the screen or terminal.

The `print()` function displays the value passed as a parameter:
```python
name = "Julian"
print(name) # displays "Julian"
```

We can print multiple values separated by commas:
```python
name = "Julian"
print("Hello", name, "!") # displays "Hello Julian!"
```

We can also use literal values without assigning to variables:
```python
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3) # displays "2 + 3 = 5"
```

### Output formatting

Python provides various ways to format output:

**f-Strings**: Allow inserting variables into a string:
```python
name = "Julian"
print(f"Hello {name}") # displays "Hello Julian"
```

**%s**: Inserts string text into a format string:
```python
name = "Julian"
print("Hello %s" % name) # displays "Hello Julian"
```

**%d**: Inserts integer numbers:
```python
value = 15
print("The value is %d" % value) # displays "The value is 15"
```

**.format()**: Inserts values into a format string:
```python
name = "Julian"
print("Hello {}!. Welcome {}.".format(name, "home")) # displays "Hello Julian!. Welcome home."
```

These formatting options allow us to interpolate variables and values into text strings to generate custom outputs. We can combine multiple values and formats in a single output string.

## Keyboard input

There are functions to read data entered by the user at runtime. This is known as *"standard input"*.

The `input()` function allows reading a value entered by the user and assigning it to a variable. For example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

This displays the message `Enter your name: ` and waits for the user to enter text and press *Enter*. That value is assigned to the `name` variable.

The `input()` function always returns a string. If we want to ask for a number or other data type, we must convert it using `int()`, `float()`, etc.:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
pi = float(input("Enter the value of pi: "))
```

### Reading multiple values

We can ask for and read multiple values on the same line separating them with commas:

```python
name, age = input("Enter name and age: ").split()
```

The `split()` method divides the input into parts and returns a list of strings. We then assign the list elements to separate variables.

We can also read multiple lines of input with a loop:

```python
names = [] # empty list

for x in range(3):
   name = input("Enter a name: ")
   names.append(name)
```

This code reads 3 names entered by the user and adds them to the `names` list.

  Don't worry about the concept of loops and this new syntax. We'll talk about in a follow-up article!

## Files

### Output to a file

In addition to printing to the screen, we can write output to a file using the `open()` function:
```python
file = open("data.txt", "w")
```

This opens `data.txt` for writing (`"w"`) and returns a file object.

Then we use `file.write()` to write to that file:
```python
file.write("Hello World!")
file.write("This text goes to the file")
```

We must close the file with `file.close()` when finished:
```python
file.close()
```

We can also use `with` to open and automatically close:
```python
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
   file.write("Hello World!")
   # no need to close, it's automatic
```

### Reading files

To read a file we use `open()` in `"r"` mode and iterate over the file object. This prints each line, including newlines.
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
   for line in file:
      print(line) # prints each line of the file
```

We can read all lines to a list with `readlines()`:
```python
lines = file.readlines()
print(lines)
```

To read the full content to a string we use `read()`:
```python
text = file.read()
print(text)
```

We can also read a specific number of bytes or characters with `read(n)`.

### Common file handling operations

There are several built-in functions to handle files in Python:
- `open()`: Opens a file and returns a file object.
- `close()`: Closes the file.
- `write()`: Writes data to the file.
- `read()`: Reads data from the file.
- `readline()`: Reads a line from the file.
- `truncate()`: Empties the file.
- `seek()`: Changes the reading/writing position.
- `rename()`: Renames the file.
- `remove()`: Deletes the file.

## Conclusion

In this article we explained Python input and output operations in detail, including reading from standard input and writing to standard output or files. Properly handling input and output is essential for many Python applications. I recommend practising with your own examples to master these functions.
