# Aggregation

Key characteristics of aggregation:
- It's a stronger relationship than a simple association, but weaker than composition.
- The "part" object can exist independently of the "whole" object.
- Multiple "whole" objects can share the same "part" object.
- If the "whole" object is destroyed, the "part" object continues to exist.

Let's look at an example to illustrate aggregation:

```python
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.append(employee)

    def remove_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.remove(employee)

    def list_employees(self):
        return f"Department {self.name} has employees: {', '.join(emp.name for emp in self.employees)}"

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Employee(name={self.name}, id={self.id})"

# Creating instances
hr_dept = Department("Human Resources")
it_dept = Department("Information Technology")

emp1 = Employee("Alice", "E001")
emp2 = Employee("Bob", "E002")
emp3 = Employee("Charlie", "E003")

# Adding employees to departments
hr_dept.add_employee(emp1)
hr_dept.add_employee(emp2)
it_dept.add_employee(emp2)  # Note: Bob works in both HR and IT
it_dept.add_employee(emp3)

print(hr_dept.list_employees())
print(it_dept.list_employees())

# If we remove the HR department, the employees still exist
del hr_dept
print(emp1)  # Employee still exists
```

In this example, we have an aggregation relationship between `Department` and `Employee`. A `Department` has `Employee`s, but `Employee`s can exist independently of any particular `Department`. Also, an `Employee` can belong to multiple `Department`s (as we see with Bob).

Here's a UML diagram representing this aggregation relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Department {
        +name: string
        +employees: list
        +add_employee(employee)
        +remove_employee(employee)
        +list_employees()
    }
    class Employee {
        +name: string
        +id: string
        +__str__()
    }
    Department o-- Employee : has
end
```

In this diagram, the open diamond on the `Department` side of the relationship indicates aggregation. This shows that `Department` is the "whole" and `Employee` is the "part" in this relationship.

It's important to note that while aggregation implies a whole-part relationship, the "part" (in this case, `Employee`) can exist independently and can even be part of multiple "wholes" (multiple `Department`s).
