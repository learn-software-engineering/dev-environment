# Composition

Key characteristics of composition:
- It represents a strong "has-a" relationship.
- The "part" object cannot exist independently of the "whole" object.
- When the "whole" object is destroyed, all its "part" objects are also destroyed.
- A "part" object belongs to only one "whole" object at a time.

Let's look at an example to illustrate composition:

```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower):
        self.horsepower = horsepower

    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, horsepower):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.engine = Engine(horsepower)  # Composition: Car creates its own Engine

    def start_car(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}: {self.engine.start()}"

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} is being destroyed, and so is its engine.")

# Creating a Car instance
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 150)
print(my_car.start_car())  # Output: Toyota Corolla: Engine started

# When we delete the Car, its Engine is also deleted
del my_car  # This will print: Toyota Corolla is being destroyed, and so is its engine.
```

In this example, we have a composition relationship between `Car` and `Engine`. A `Car` has an `Engine`, and the `Engine` cannot exist independently of the `Car`. When a `Car` object is created, it creates its own `Engine`. When the `Car` object is destroyed, its `Engine` is also destroyed.

Here's a UML diagram representing this composition relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        +make: string
        +model: string
        -engine: Engine
        +start_car()
        +__del__()
    }
    class Engine {
        -horsepower: int
        +start()
    }
    Car *-- Engine : has
end
```

In this diagram, the filled diamond on the `Car` side of the relationship indicates composition. This shows that `Car` is the "whole" and `Engine` is the "part" in this relationship, and that the `Engine`'s lifetime is tied to the `Car`'s lifetime.

The key difference between aggregation and composition is the strength of the relationship and the lifecycle dependency. In aggregation, the "part" can exist independently of the "whole", while in composition, the "part" cannot exist without the "whole".
