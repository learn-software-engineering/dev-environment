# Stacks
The **LIFO** nature of stacks is due to the fact that only the top element can be accessed and manipulated. The operation of placing an element on the stack is known as *"push"*, while removing an element from the stack is a *"pop"*. The LIFO operation causes the last element placed in a stack to be the first to be removed.

## Main operations

The primary operations supported by a stack structure are:

- **Push:** adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** removes the element at the top of the stack.
- **Peek:** allows accessing the top element without removing it from the stack.
- **isEmpty:** checks if the stack is empty.

Most languages like Python and Java provide stack implementations in their standard libraries.

## Implementation

A stack can be implemented using a linked list so that each node points to the previous node.

## Usage examples

Stacks have many uses in programming:

- **Execution stack (call stack)**: records pending function calls to resolve. Implements expected LIFO behaviour.

- **Browser stack**: allows going back (undo) in the browser history similarly to a LIFO stack.

- **Math expression execution**: stacks can verify parentheses, brackets, braces, etc.

- **Algorithms and data structures**: like in the quicksort algorithm and in data path implementations.

## Conclusion

Stacks are versatile data structures thanks to their LIFO operation principle. Having a good command of stacks, their uses and applications is essential in computer science.
